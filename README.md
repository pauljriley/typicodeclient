# typicodeclient

Using the API endpoint
GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments

create a simple Android app with two screens:

##Screen1: A screen containing a list of posts
a title
a list view. Tapping a cell should take you to Screen2; each cell displaying:
  - post title

##Screen2: The detail screen for the selected post
back button should take you back to screen 1
title
labels for the fields:
  - post title
  - post body
  - user name
  - number of comments

##Bonus:
Based on the user’s email address, use http://avatars.adorable.io to generate a unique avatar for each of the contacts. To be shown on both screens.

##Task guidelines:
Use of 3rd party libraries (and dependency management) is accepted and encouraged.
The task is simple, but you should demonstrate a good and scalable architecture that would work within bigger apps. Show off a little! (Just don’t overdo it :) )
We expect the app to be unit tested. It’s up to you if you want to write other kinds of tests.
